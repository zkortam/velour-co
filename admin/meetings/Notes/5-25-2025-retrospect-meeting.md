## Agenda

Hold a quick sprint retrospective meeting where everyone has a chance to say what worked and what didn’t in the sprint review.

## Retrospect Meeting

- Testing-wise HTML and CSS validators are now built in. We aren’t writing unit tests but if you want help writing some ask Rain.  
- Website homepage looks completed with the website working now on mobile view as well.  
- **Talked about how people who have tasks that are interconnected should work together. Everyone did their tasks but some had questions about how to connect their work with others.**  
- **Shopping cart feature works well with the recipe cards that now store ingredients in an array instead of a long string.**  

## Next Action Items

- For the next sprint we are going to start putting things together to preview everything.  
- Niroop – Merge what Luis and Zoey did so that the created cards have the intended look.  
- Anu (Home), Anna (Calendar), Kelvin (My Recipes) – Each of you is responsible for the look of your page but come up with a uniform look and feel for the website.  
- Zoey, Kelvin, Thanh, Felicia, Niroop – Add the cards and meals to the “My Recipes” page. Decide a shelf for the cards where there are different rows for different difficulties, tags, recently created, etc. Meals should have something that is displayed (kinda like the image on the GitHub issue assigned to Felicia and Thanh).  
- Mehdi – Continue adding accessibility features and recipe import now that we have a complete card structure. Just find a way to save to local storage.  
- Manan – Get ingredients from local storage and add those ingredients to the cart. Add a “Buy Now” button to the card display. Will the shopping cart be its own page? If so, work with Anu, Anna, and Kelvin to get a uniform look. If not, then share your solution.  
- Overall, good job everyone. This upcoming sprint will focus on merging everything together, so please be communicative and let us know if you have any questions.
